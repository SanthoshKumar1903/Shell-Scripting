# Shell Scripting in Linux

Welcome to my **Shell Scripting in Linux** repository! This repo contains a collection of shell scripts, ranging from beginner to advanced level, that I've written during my learning journey. The goal is to help automate tasks, solve problems, and explore the full potential of shell scripting on Linux systems. Feel free to use it.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine to get started with the scripts:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shell-scripting.git
cd shell-scripting
